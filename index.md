## About Us

The Wheel Deal is an all girl [FIRST&reg; LEGO&reg; League](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/fll) team from Oakville, Ontario, Canada. Our team has eight members and four mentors &mdash; two adults and two youth mentors from [FRC Team 1360, Orbit Robotics](https://1360.ca/).

We are all in grades 5-8 and five of us were on the team last year. Six of us have previous experience while the other two are new to LEGO&reg; robotics.

Our team members do a variety of different activities in addition to LEGO&reg; Robotics such as swimming, aerial acrobatics, and soccer.

We are sponsored by Oakville Community FIRST&reg; Robotics Team, Inc..
